# IllusionBreaker Environment Variables
# This project does NOT require any environment variables to run

# No API keys needed - all analysis is done locally using heuristics
# No external services - no paid APIs or cloud services
# No database - no connection strings needed

# For local development, simply run:
# npm run dev

# For production deployment on Vercel:
# No environment variables need to be configured
# The project works out of the box with zero configuration
